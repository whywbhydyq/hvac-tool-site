const standardFaqs = [
  {
    question: 'Which HVAC calculator should I start with?',
    answer: 'Use the AC BTU calculator for room cooling, the portable AC calculator when a unit lists SACC or multiple BTU ratings, the dehumidifier calculator for moisture control, and the CFM / ACH calculators for airflow estimates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does the calculator show a range instead of one exact number?',
    answer: 'Room comfort depends on ceiling height, windows, insulation, sun exposure, moisture sources, installation details and product labels. A range is more useful for early comparison than a pseudo-exact number.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use this instead of Manual J or a contractor review?',
    answer: 'No. These tools are for room-level preliminary estimates. Whole-home HVAC design, duct sizing, equipment selection, electrical work, combustion safety, mold remediation and code compliance require qualified review.'
  }
];

const acFaqs = [
  ...standardFaqs,
  {
    question: 'How should I choose between two common AC sizes?',
    answer: 'Start with the calculator range, then check sun exposure, ceiling height, kitchen heat, insulation and the product label. If the room is humid, avoid sizing far above the calculated range because oversizing can cool quickly without removing enough moisture.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does this work for central AC sizing?',
    answer: 'No. The AC calculator is for room, window and portable AC estimates. Central systems need load calculations, duct review, airflow checks and installation-specific design.'
  }
];

const dehumidifierFaqs = [
  ...standardFaqs,
  {
    question: 'Is dehumidifier capacity the same as bucket size?',
    answer: 'No. Capacity usually refers to moisture removal per day under rating conditions. Bucket volume only describes how much water the tank can hold before emptying.'
  },
  {
    question: 'When should I use a larger dehumidifier range?',
    answer: 'Use the higher end when the space is very damp, cool, below grade, has water intrusion, dries laundry, or needs continuous operation. Fixing water sources and drainage often matters more than buying a larger unit.'
  }
];

const ventilationFaqs = [
  ...standardFaqs,
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between CFM and ACH?',
    answer: 'CFM is airflow volume per minute. ACH is how many times the room air volume is exchanged per hour. The conversion depends on room volume, so the same CFM can produce different ACH in different rooms.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can this confirm code-compliant ventilation?',
    answer: 'No. The calculators explain the math and help with early planning, but code-compliant ventilation depends on room use, local rules, equipment ratings, ducts, controls and inspection requirements.'
  }
];

const conversionFaqs = [
  ...standardFaqs,
  {
    question: 'Are BTU, tons and kW all the same kind of value?',
